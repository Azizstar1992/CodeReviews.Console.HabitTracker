This is a habit tracker.

you have a menu,

press 0 to exit application
press 1 to view all records
press 2 to insert a new habit
Press 3 to delete a habit
press 4 to update a habit

when inserting or updating 
You must state the date in this format (dd-MM-YY);
You must state the type of habit, text format max 20 characters
You must state an integer amount, any non numeric value will be rejected

for deleting a habit, you must state the Id of the record you wish to delete.
dont worry a list of database will be printed for you, once deleted, it cant be brought back.

if you are having an issue loading the project make sure you are going down all the way to habit_tracker folder. i kept the CodeReviews.Console.HabitTracker.sln and it can interfere with the project running.
